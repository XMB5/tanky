In addition to completing the project, your group will need to maintain a log of who does what throughout the project. The log should be written in **this README** and updated consistently to reflect the group's progression. For more details about what this log should contain, please read the following document https://sof.tware.design/22sp/documents/project-logs.

This project log is **mandatory** - if you do not have a complete and proper project log, **you will not be able to have in-person office hours or code reviews with your TAs**.

# Log Entries
## (Sample) Wednesday, 3/23, 9:30 - 11:30pm
**WHO:** Sarah and Alice

**WHAT:** Working on wc.c, particularly reading in characters from a file

**BUGS:** We kept reading past the end of the file, so our while loop would run forever. We fixed this by reading the documentation for fread to figure out how to check the return condition correctly, and changing our code accordingly

**RESOURCES USED:** https://sof.tware.design/22sp/docs/fread
